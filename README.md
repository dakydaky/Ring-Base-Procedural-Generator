# Ring-Base Procedural Generator

~ "this is pretty smart" - Awesome people from Ghost Ship Games.

Developed for the DADIU program during the period of five days; a fully fledged procedural-generation algorithm implementation that generates varied, extensible forests and structures to populate the forest. The system was developed for a video game now released on itch.io. The maps are scalable in size, the forest density is fully adjustable (and can differ for the different biomes), and the biomes are added to the generator in the form of ScriptableData objects which makes additional biomes easy to implement. What is more, the unique ring-based procedural generation is developed fully without any previous reference, and relies on its' own set of algorithms to be make the forest alive. Basically, anything about the biome rings and the forest itself is fully modular. You might even be able to make it into a city instead. You do you.
